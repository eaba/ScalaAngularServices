# Angular Services in Scala

This is a demonstration of the possibilities of using [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) for making [Angular](https://angular.io/).

This repo is used as illustration for the medium blog post available [here](todo). The commits of this repo follow the content of that article, and present a nice history of things.

## Run it

In order to run the project, you will need [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) installed and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Once sbt is installed, run `sbt makeModule`. Then head over the `webapp/FromScalaWithLove`, run `npm i` and then `ng serve`. Head over `localhost:4200`. Magic should happen.

### Kudos

The project uses the [ScalablyTyped](https://scalablytyped.org/docs/readme.html) and the [ScalaTs](https://github.com/swachter/scala-ts) plugins. Big kudos to their authors.
